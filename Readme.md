# **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Assistant**

Welcome to the **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Assistant**! This application leverages **React** for the frontend, **Flask** for the backend, and OpenAI's GPT for generating intelligent responses. The assistant converts your spoken queries into text, processes them using a powerful AI model, and responds audibly to create an interactive conversational experience.

## **Architecture Overview**

This app consists of the following key components:

- **Frontend**: Built using React for user interaction.
- **Backend**: Flask-based Python backend for audio processing, AI interaction, and speech synthesis.
- **Speech-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper for high-accuracy transcription.
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT for dynamic query responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: `gTTS` for converting text to audio responses.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- Ensure both the frontend and backend servers are running.
- Check the microphone and audio playback settings on your device.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the log outputs from the terminal for debugging.
